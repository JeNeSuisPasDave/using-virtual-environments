# Using Virtual Environments

This repository contains example code to support a series of blog posts that discuss virtual environments for [Python][python], [Ruby][ruby], [Node.js][node], and [Go][go]. The series discusses the value of virtual environments and digs in to way to automate their management, and automate various common development tasks within virtual environments.

[python]: https://www.python.org/
[ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[go]: https://golang.org/

Examples are primarily developed on OS X, but where possible examples are also provided for Windows.
